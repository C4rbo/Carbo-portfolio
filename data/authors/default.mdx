I'm **Carbo**, living in Apulia, Italy. I am a **software developer** and **cybersecurity enthusiast**, currently studying **Computer Science** at the University of Bari Aldo Moro (Uniba).

### Developer Journey

I started my journey into IT as a **self-taught** learner. You can see some of my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/C4rbo) profile.

Throughout my journey, I have used several technologies:

- **Python:** The language I use most frequently, employed for software development, CTF labs, and more.
- **Java:** Used for personal projects.
- **C/C++:** Studied at university and further explored through programming and cybersecurity competitions.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The classic foundations for website creation.
- **JavaScript / TypeScript (Node.js, React, Next.js):** Self-taught and used to build this very site and other personal projects.
- **Database (SQL, MySQL):** I studied SQL at university.
- **Docker:** Used for environment management and deployment.

### Passion for Cybersecurity

My passion for **cybersecurity** sparked thanks to the [CyberChallengeIT](https://www.cyberchallenge.it/) project in **2025**. This experience introduced me to a fascinating world and allowed me to meet experts with whom I collaborate in various **CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions**, constantly expanding my knowledge.

Currently, I don't have specific work experience in this field, but I am **open to opportunities** that would allow me to enter the cybersecurity sector professionally.
